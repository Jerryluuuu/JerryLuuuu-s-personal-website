    "text": "Hello there! I’m currently navigating the exciting world of economics, statistics, and political science as an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto. The interplay between these subjects fascinates me, as they collectively unravel the complexities of our world’s financial systems, governance, and data-driven decisions. My academic journey is just a stepping stone, as I’m passionately working towards pursuing a master’s degree in these fields. My knack for numbers and trends has led me to dive deep into the realms of R, Python, and SQL. I’m on a continuous quest to hone my skills in these powerful tools, aiming to leverage data in innovative ways to understand and solve real-world problems. When I’m not buried in datasets or academic texts, you can find me on the golf course or basketball court. Golf has been a part of my life for over a decade, teaching me patience and precision, while basketball keeps me agile and always thinking on my feet. I’m also an avid gamer, especially fond of FPS games where I thrive as an in-game leader, strategizing and leading my team to victory. This blend of analytical thinking and teamwork spills over into my academic and personal pursuits, shaping me into a well-rounded individual eager to make an impact. Whether it’s through numbers, on the field, or in a digital arena, I’m all about taking on challenges and pushing boundaries. Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I share my journey, insights, and adventures in academia, sports, and beyond!"
